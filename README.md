# Brainstorming Repository

A personal workspace for capturing ideas, notes, and experiments before they find their final purpose.

## Purpose

This repository serves as a digital brainstorming space where I can:
- Store quick notes and thoughts
- Save AI-generated content and prompts
- Create proof-of-concept (POC) projects
- Collect research materials and references
- Experiment with new concepts

## Structure

Content is organized organically as ideas develop. Expect to find:
- **Notes/** - Raw thoughts and documentation
- **Experiments/** - Code snippets and POCs
- **Research/** - Links, articles, and reference materials
- **AI-Generated/** - Content created with AI assistance

## Usage

This is a personal workspace for idea development. Files may be:
- Temporary and experimental
- In various states of completion
- Moved to more permanent repositories when mature
- Deleted if no longer relevant

## Philosophy

> "Capture first, organize later."

The goal is to remove friction from idea capture while maintaining enough structure to find and build upon previous thoughts.
